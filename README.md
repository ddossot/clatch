# Clatch

A Clojure-powered [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), built on top of [play-clj](https://github.com/oakes/play-clj).


## Motivation

To provide a transition path between Scratch and a general programming language.


## But why Clojure?

- Because it's a joy to write, really, it has close to no syntax, only structure,
- Because macros simplify the reification of Scratch building blocks,
- Because [play-clj](https://github.com/oakes/play-clj) is a super powerful game library, which can target desktop, iOS and Android platforms,
- Because [Nightmod](https://github.com/oakes/Nightmod) can deliver a Scratch-like programming experience.


## Contributions welcome!

Help with the following would be great:

- more support of core Scratch features,
- Leiningen template,
- Nightmod template.
